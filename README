    1. YbEd - Editor for the future Yabasic 3

== 1. YbEd ==

    YbEd is an editor aimed at being as closely tied as possible to Yabasic.
For example, it will tie in with the interpreter (messages, breakpoints, etc).
    It's current objectives are:
        - show all messages (error, info, etc) inside the editor
        - set breakpoints in the program
        - show all debug information avaiable inside the editor
        - create projects
